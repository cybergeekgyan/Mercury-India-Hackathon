### Filecoin
Filecoin and IPFS are complementary protocols for storing and sharing data in the distributed web. Both systems are free, open-source, and share many building blocks, including data representation formats (IPLD) and network communication protocols (libp2p).

### Flow
‍Flow is a fast, decentralized, and developer-friendly blockchain, designed as the foundation for a new generation of games, apps, and the digital assets that power them. It is based on a unique, multi-role architecture, and designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.

### Decentology
Decentology makes it easy for developers to build decentralized applications using DappStarter, its code generation platform. In addition, Decentology is launching Hyperverse, a platform that enables developers to build sophisticated web3 apps with monetization and audit-based insurance built in.
